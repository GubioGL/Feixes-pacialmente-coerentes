# Simulations of Partially Coherent Beams

This repository contains the simulation files mentioned in the article "[Partially Coherent Beam: Theory and Simulation](https://arxiv.org/html/2403.09306v1)". The codes are designed to be executed directly on Google Colab, providing an easy and interactive experience.

## Repository Contents

- [**codigo_1.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cfaWoW_7kQay29f0Y_2fSL0eEL_K_4U6?usp=sharing): This notebook provides a simplified step-by-step guide on how to generate and visualize the intensity of a light beam.

- [**codigo_2.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IxE_cqzmSVsMS9EYum-5EeM7iQnG56eT?usp=sharing): In this notebook, we generate a Gaussian Schell Model (GSM) beam using coherent mode decomposition. We compare the simulation intensity with the theoretical and determine the ideal truncation value for decomposition.

- [**codigo_3.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TlsA_OI9Fa2h6UAJpeXm80hJPOi0LRzD?usp=sharing): We use the GSM beam to determine the normalized cross-spectral density.

- [**codigo_4.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RHAvGmYwaM_psCVFFV8IF_Gnm-wkX4xf?usp=sharing): In this notebook, we apply the GSM beam to a double slit and check the beam's degree of coherence.

- [**codigo_5.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H-0bhR-NAUemY0VDAF6itJHMnyXhQLOs?usp=sharing): In code 5, we obtain the intensity of the GSM beam with the decomposition in pseudomodes.

- [**codigo_6.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_EKw1TqVODn5SpvLrq13OcS9Vtpl7rJV?usp=sharing): In code 6, we determine the number of modes in the coherent and incoherent sum used in the decomposition in pseudomodes.

- [**codigo_7.ipynb**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1AzzkUAmx6RYMLjAR8BRm49NZpoggVIkG?usp=sharing): In code 7, we use the generated GSM beam to perform the double slit experiment and determine visibility.
